		<p> Eaton Centre is the biggest mall and the top attraction in downtown, Toronto and North America's busiest mall. This complex offers more than 250 stores and restaurants. CF Toronto Eaton Centre offers its customers the option to park and lock up their bicycles at our secure bike racks located in the Bay and Dundas parkade. We have 60 spaces available free of cost, on a first come first serve basis. More than 35 years after it opened to the public, the Eaton Centre remains the largest shopping mall in Toronto. The massive galleried retail centre was built in phases, starting with the Dundas Street end in the mid 1970s. The first section of mall, the nine storey, 93,000 square metre anchor store, opened in 1977. </p>
		<p> From Monday to Saturday this mall is open from 9:30AM to 9:00PM, yet on Sundays it opens at 10:00AM nd closes at 7:00PM. </p>
